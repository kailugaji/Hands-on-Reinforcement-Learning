Introduction of a higher-level RL library (PTAN) and Implementation of DQN with Python  
Note: The network architecture of my DQN is not a standard structure with three convolution layers and two full connection layers, but is simplified to two full connection layers, the implementation of the standard DQN can be found in https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On-Second-Edition/tree/master/Chapter08  
PTAN: https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan  
Install PTAN  
```
pip install torch==1.7.0+cpu torchvision==0.8.1+cpu torchaudio===0.7.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html  
pip install ptan  
```
